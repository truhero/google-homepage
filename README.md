This is my first mini-project from 'THE ODIN PROJECT.' 

GOAL: (1) To deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it (i.e. the Goole Homepage). (2) To start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get style and aligned.

REFLECTION:
  (1) This is my first project with HTML/CSS and I feel like I am learning a lot of what not to do. 
          -- My first mistake occured when I first started coding the top navigation bar. Instead properly 'griding (?right word?)' the page correctly, I basically just put the elements 'where I want them' with some pretty nasty code. 
  
  (2)
